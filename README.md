# Handwriting Recognition Deep Learning App Mobile 

## objective
The objective of this project is to design a convolutional neural network for image classification. The initial tests will be conducted on the MNIST database, which consists of handwritten digit images. Once the network has been trained, it will be presented with an image of a digit that it hasn't seen during training, and its output should be the recognized digit.

## Dataset
Handwritten character recognition is a challenging problem and serves as a good test for learning algorithms. The MNIST dataset has become a standard benchmark for this task. It comprises 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, derived from a previous database called NIST. These images are black and white, normalized and centered, with dimensions of 28 pixels on each side.
